# The `TableJoinProcessor` object handles joining streams with in-memory tables in ballerina.
# `nextProcessor` is the `process` function of the next processor, which can be a `Select` processor, `Aggregator`
# processor, `Having` processor.. etc. The `streamName` is the stream of the join and its attached
# window is `'windowInstance`. The `tableName` is the name of the table with which the stream is joined. The
# `joinType` is the type of the join and it can be any value defined by `streams:JoinType`.
