# The `StreamJoinProcessor` object is responsible for  performing SQLish joins between two or more streams.
# The `onConditionFunc` is the lambda function which represents the where clause in the join clause. The joining
# happens only if the condition is statified. `nextProcessor` is the `process` function of the next processor, which
# can be a `Select` processor, `Aggregator` processor, `Having` processor.. etc. The `lhsStream` is the left hand side
# stream of the join and its attached window is `'lhsWindow`. The `rhsStream` is the right hand side stream of the join
# and its attached window is `'rhsWindow`. The `unidirectionalStream` stream defines the stream by which the joining is
# triggered when the events are received. Usually it is `lhsStream`, in rare cases it can be `rhsStream`. The
# `joinType` is the type of the join and it can be any value defined by `streams:JoinType`.
