# Struct which represents Kafka Producer configuration.
#
# + bootstrapServers - List of remote server endpoints of Kafka brokers.
# + acks - Number of acknowledgments. This can be either `kafka:ACKS_ALL`, `kafka:ACKS_SINGLE` or `kafka:ACKS_NONE`.
# + compressionType - Compression type to be used for messages.
# + clientId - Identifier to be used for server side logging.
# + metricsRecordingLevel - Metrics recording level.
# + metricReporterClasses - Metrics reporter classes.
# + partitionerClass - Partitioner class to be used to select partition to which the message is sent.
# + interceptorClasses - Interceptor classes to be used before sending records.
# + transactionalId - Transactional ID to be used in transactional delivery.
# + bufferMemory - Total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records.
# + retryCount - Number of retries to resend a record.
# + batchSize - Number of records to be batched for a single request. Use 0 for no batching.
# + linger - Delay to allow other records to be batched.
# + sendBuffer - Size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF).
# + receiveBuffer - Size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF).
# + maxRequestSize - The maximum size of a request in bytes.
# + reconnectBackoffTimeInMillis - Time to wait before attempting to reconnect.
# + reconnectBackoffMaxTimeInMillis - Maximum amount of time in milliseconds to wait when reconnecting.
# + retryBackoffTimeInMillis - Time to wait before attempting to retry a failed request.
# + maxBlock - Maximum block time which the send is blocked, when the buffer is full.
# + requestTimeoutInMillis - Wait time for response of a request.
# + metadataMaxAgeInMillis - Maximum time to force a refresh of metadata.
# + metricsSampleWindowInMillis - Time window for a metrics sample to computed over.
# + metricsNumSamples - Number of samples maintained to compute metrics.
# + maxInFlightRequestsPerConnection - Maximum number of unacknowledged requests on a single connection.
# + connectionsMaxIdleTimeInMillis - Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds.
# + transactionTimeoutInMillis - Timeout for transaction status update from the producer.
# + enableIdempotence - Exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream when enabled.
# + secureSocket - Configurations related to SSL/TLS.
