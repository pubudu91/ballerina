// Ballerina supports re-ordering table rows in ascending or descending order by the given fields. In this example, all the
// rows in the person table are ordered in ascending order by the field "salary". This query syntax can only be used to
// query a table. The modification of an existing table is not supported. When an existing table is queried using Ballerina
// SQL, a new in-memory table is created with the queried data and that table is returned. Executing these SQL-like
// queries on tables returned through Ballerina database clients is not supported yet.
