# Since resource configuration has overridden the required scopes to denote that

$ curl -k -u generalUser1:password https://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello
Authorization failure

# Since `generalUser2` has `scope2` the invocation will succeeded.
$ curl -k -u generalUser2:password https://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello
Hello, World!!!
