// Ballerina supports grouping table rows using queries similar to SQL. In this example, order entries are grouped by
// person IDs. This query syntax can only be used to query a table. The modification of an existing table is not supported.
// When an existing table is queried using Ballerina SQL, a new in-memory table is created with the queried data and
// that table is returned. Executing these SQL-like queries on tables returned through Ballerina database clients is not
// supported yet.
