// Ballerina allows querying in-memory tables with syntax similar to SQL. To select all the columns/fields from the
// source table, "*" can be used along with the select clause. In this example, an exact copy of the source table is
// created. This query syntax can only be used to query a table. The modification of an existing table is not supported.
// When an existing table is queried using Ballerina SQL, a new in-memory table is created with the queried data and
// that table is returned. Executing these SQL-like queries on tables returned through Ballerina database clients is not
// supported yet.
