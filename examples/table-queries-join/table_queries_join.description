// Ballerina supports joining two tables using queries similar to SQL. In this particular example, two tables, one
// with persons' details and another with order details are joined together. Both tables have the person ID, which
// is used to join. This query syntax can only be used to query a table. The modification of an existing table is not
// supported, When an existing table is queried using Ballerina SQL, a new in-memory table is created with the queried
// data and that table is returned. Executing these SQL-like queries on tables returned through Ballerina database
// clients is not supported yet.
