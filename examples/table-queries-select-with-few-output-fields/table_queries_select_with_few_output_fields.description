// Ballerina allows users to select specific fields from a table using a query syntax similar to SQL. In this example, the
// public profiles of people are selected (i.e., only the name and the age are selected) and it returns a table of public
// profiles. This query syntax can only be used to query a table. The modification of an existing table is not supported.
// When an existing table is queried using Ballerina SQL, a new in-memory table is created with the queried data and
// that table is returned. Executing these SQL-like queries on tables returned through Ballerina database clients is not
// supported yet.
