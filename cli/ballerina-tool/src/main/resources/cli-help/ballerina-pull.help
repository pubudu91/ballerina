         Ballerina Central is a module repository hosted at
         https://central.ballerina.io/. A module repository organizes modules
         into a three-level hierarchy: organization, module name, and version.
         Organizations are unique within a repository and can be mapped to an
         individual user or organization registered with the repository.

EXAMPLES

         from Ballerina Central.
